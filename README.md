* FoodTrail is a restaurant logging application for food lovers who want to keep track of restaurants they are
  interested in. It serves as a personal diary for recording restaurants they have visited or wish to visit.

* FoodTrail maintains a curated record of dining experiences. It eliminates the need for scattered notes or relying on
  memory. It helps food enthusiasts to remember their favourites and keep track of places that they may want to visit.

* The project is built on top of a software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing
  contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FoodTrail Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t14-3.github.io/tp)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
